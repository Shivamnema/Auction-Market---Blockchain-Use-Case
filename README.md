# Auction-Market---Blockchain-Use-Case
# Problem Statement 
“Auction Market”, Where any one can submit asset or item with description, price, duration of auction, buy now value etc. Also they are allowed to bid on any item of their choice, track the status of an item on auction list.

# Introduction

This project aims to decentralize the process of bidding, purchasing and registring assets  in the auctions. Here, the  bidders can place bids in the open auction created on the blockchain. All the data is stored in the big chain database. Later,When the auction is over and bid reach a buy now price the asset ownership will be transfered.
