# Generic Functions for JavaScript

It's time to bring something <s>new</s> old to JavaScript: generic functions!

# Why?

Polymorphism in JavaScript is changing:

* ES 6 brings an important new interface, the [Iterable](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-iterable-interface), which isn't a type so you can't use inheritance with it.
* After getting `Object.create` added to the language, [Douglas Crockford doesn't use it any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4&feature=youtu.be&t=18m54s).

# What are Generic Functions?

Generic functions were popularized in the [Common Lisp Object System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System), published in 1988.

# Usage

Let's suppose you want to write a function `map` that works on both Arrays and Sets and supports mapping functions as well as mapping objects.

You can do that by writing a method for each of the four possible argument combinations.

```JavaScript
const assert = require('assert')
const generic = require('@nodeguy/generic')

const map = generic.function()

map.method([m => typeof m === 'function', Array.isArray],
  (mapper, array) =>
    array.map(mapper)
)

map.method([m => typeof m === 'object', Array.isArray],
  (mapper, array) =>
    array.map(value => mapper[value])
)

map.method([m => typeof m === 'function', c => c instanceof Set],
  (mapper, set) =>
    new Set(Array.from(set).map(mapper))
)

map.method([m => typeof m === 'object', c => c instanceof Set],
  (mapper, set) =>
    new Set(Array.from(set).map(value => mapper[value]))
)

assert.deepEqual(map(Math.sqrt, [1, 4, 9]), [1, 2, 3])
assert.deepEqual(map({1: 1, 4: 2, 9: 3}, [1, 4, 9]), [1, 2, 3])
assert.deepEqual(map(Math.sqrt, new Set([1, 4, 9])), new Set([1, 2, 3]))

assert.deepEqual(
  map({1: 1, 4: 2, 9: 3}, new Set([1, 4, 9])),
  new Set([1, 2, 3])
)
```

See `test/index.js` for more usage examples.
