This is a [JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/) client library.  It is compliant with the [JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

# Why?

I wrote yet another JSON-RPC library in JavaScript because the existing solutions I looked at tied themselves to a specific transport (e.g., HTTP) or were more complicated to use than just calling a function.  RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call so it should be as simple to use as calling a procedure.

# Usage

You set up the library by giving it a *transport* which is a function that takes an [AsyncIterable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration) and returns an AsyncIterable.  This simple interface gives it the power to work with any underlying transport (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket, etc.).  HTTP and WebSocket transports are provided.

Once initialized, it returns an object called `methods` that is an object representing the server.  Calling a method on the server is as simple as calling the method on the `methods` object.  All methods return promises.

# Examples

## HTTP

```JavaScript
const assert = require('assert')
const jsonRpc = require('@nodeguy/json-rpc')
const url = require('url')

const transport = jsonRpc.transport(url.parse('http://www.example.com'))
const client = jsonRpc.client(transport)
const server = client.methods

server.subtract(42, 23).then((response) => {
  assert.equal(response, 19)
}
```

## WebSocket

```JavaScript
const assert = require('assert')
const jsonRpc = require('@nodeguy/json-rpc')
const url = require('url')

const transport = jsonRpc.transport(url.parse('ws://www.example.com'))
const client = jsonRpc.client(transport)
const server = client.methods

server.subtract(42, 23).then((response) => {
  assert.equal(response, 19)
}
```
