# Iteray!

a collection of functions for use with Iterable, [AsyncIterable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration), and Array

You already know the basic operations because they're the methods for Array: `concat`, `every`, `filter`, etc.

Now you can use them on Iterable, AsyncIterable (a lightweight stream), arguments, Object properties, Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet, and all of the [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) data structures*.

Why is this cool?  Because you can use exactly the same code for time and space operations!

Huh?

That means you can test your streaming code using arrays!

The API documentation is in the [wiki](https://github.com/NodeGuy/iteray/wiki).

*Much of the implementation is TBD.  Pull requests welcome.
