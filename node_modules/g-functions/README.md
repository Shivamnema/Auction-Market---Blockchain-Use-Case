# G.Functions

a non-opinionated library of generic functions for functional programming in JavaScript

## Installation

```shell
$ yarn add g-functions
```

## Usage in Node.js

```JavaScript
'use strict'

const assert = require('assert')
const G = require('g-functions')

it('maps and reduces', function () {
  assert.equal(
    G.reduce(G.concat, '', G.reverse(G.map(
      G.toUpperCase,
      G.split(' ', undefined, 'Why are you talking so loud and fast?')
    ))),
    'WHYAREYOUTALKINGSOLOUDANDFAST?'
  )
})
```

## API

See the [documentation](doc/index.md) for the list of functions.

## Benefits

* non-opinionated
* point-free
* curried

### Non-Opinionated

The library contains 122 functions.  You won't need to refer to the documentation often, nor will the readers of your code, because the semantics are the same as for the methods of JavaScript's standard object types.  This improves readability.

### Point-Free

The function signatures have been modified to support [point-free programming](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/pointfree-javascript/) by moving the method object to the last argument.

For example, suppose you want to convert an array of strings to upper case.

#### Without G.Functions

```JavaScript
array.map(string => string.toUpperCase())
```

#### With G.Functions

```JavaScript
G.map(G.toUpperCase, array)
```

### All Functions are Curried

All of the functions are [curried](https://hughfdjackson.com/javascript/why-curry-helps/) so you could write this:

```JavaScript
const arrayToUpperCase = G.map(G.toUpperCase)

arrayToUpperCase(array)
```

To make this work, all optional arguments are now required.

#### Without G.Functions

```JavaScript
[1, 2, 3].slice()
```

#### With G.Functions

```JavaScript
G.slice(0, undefined, [1, 2, 3])
```
